# CLI Surface Reconciliation Contract

Primary surface: CLI/TUI

Before a user-facing release is accepted, execute the exact candidate through the real operator entry point and reconcile commands/prompts/output against the committed README/operator guidance.

Required PASS evidence:
- the documented entry point starts on a supported environment or safe fixture;
- the primary operator flow is discoverable without undocumented commands;
- cancellation/help/dry-run behavior matches the documented safety model;
- no credential or secret value is echoed into evidence;
- candidate HEAD and observed command/output are recorded.

Static parsing or unit tests alone are not user-surface execution PASS.

## Engineering System User Acceptance v2 — mandatory execution semantics

This repository-local contract inherits the portable semantics from
`datarelay-labs/engineering-system@fb431381ef4c49851fc40b683e8bad22607e7e0c/standards/USER_ACCEPTANCE.md`.
The project-specific scenarios above remain authoritative for this product; the rules below are additional mandatory execution rules.

- **ChatGPT itself is the executor and final auditor.** ChatGPT directly acts as the applicable real User/Operator/Admin persona and drives the actual supported public surface. A coding agent, alternate model, wrapper, scripted replay, CI job, unit/component/API suite, or static scanner is supporting evidence only and cannot produce Surface Reconciliation PASS.
- Start **feature-first and black-box-first**. Build/confirm the supported capability inventory, then let the acting persona discover each applicable capability from the public UI/CLI/help/navigation/error/output. Do not preload source code, test code, internal routes/catalogs, hidden APIs, implementation details, or a scenario answer key into the acting persona.
- After a surface's public evidence is frozen, post-hoc source/config/parser/route/static inspection may be used by the auditor to find hidden, duplicate, stale, orphaned, or undiscoverable surfaces. Auditor knowledge must not be fed back as prior knowledge to the persona.
- Reconcile every applicable capability through discovery, role/context, terminology, state/empty/error semantics, next action, recovery guidance, and destructive/risky-action safety. Every mandatory capability and public control must receive an explicit disposition; blocked/partial/not-run is never silently converted to PASS.
- **A finding is not a stop condition.** Preserve it and continue every safe independent scenario. Do not patch product/source/contract during the frozen discovery pass. After all safe executable checks are exhausted, freeze the complete finding set, remediate it as one bounded batch, then start a new run from the beginning.
- Use the actual primary surface. Browser projects require a real Chromium/Chrome process driven by ChatGPT; CLI projects require the actual supported public CLI/TUI. jsdom/component/API/static checks and automation harnesses do not substitute for the user action.
- Retain exact candidate HEAD, committed contract identity/digest, scenario/findings ledgers, and ledger-derived summary. Release PASS requires 100% applicable capability/public-surface coverage, zero mandatory FAIL/PARTIAL/BLOCKED, zero unresolved blocking finding, and clean exact-HEAD evidence.
- If the product explicitly supports an AI-assisted user path, mirror the same user goal through that path using only information visible to the user and require semantically equivalent supported guidance/outcome.
